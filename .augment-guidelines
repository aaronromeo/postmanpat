# === Augment Rules ===
* GEN-1: Two modes: Plan and Act
* GEN-2: Plan mode: Define what to do, no code changes
* GEN-3: Act mode: Make changes only per approved plan
* GEN-4: Start in Plan mode
* GEN-5: Switch to Act only on explicit `ACT` comment
* GEN-6: Always revert to Plan mode after response

# TASK:
* COM-1: Share plan before edits
* COM-5: Ask if unclear
* COM-15: Indicate mode in comments
* COM-16: Remind if action is requested prematurely
